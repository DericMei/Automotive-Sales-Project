# **Automobile Sales in the United Sates**

An interactive dashboard project analyzing automobile sales statistics in the United States built using dash and deployed with heroku.

## Project Summary
This is the final project I did by taking the Coursera course 'Data Visualization with Python'. It involves building an interactive dashboard with dash and plotly within python and finally web application deployment with Heroku. It involves analyzing automobile sales during all the recession periods during the recent few decades. The interactive dashboard also provides the function to dive into different years of auto sales data.

## Key Take-aways
- Automobile sales drastically decreases during all the recession periods.
- Sports and Executive cars sales a lot less than other more affordable cars such as small family cars.
- There isn't a clear seasonal trend in car sales.
- Overall, medium family car is the most popular type.

## Tools Used
Python, Heroku, Visual Studio Codes

## Data Science Techniques Used
Pandas, Dash, EDA, Plotly, Data Visualization, Interactive Dashboards, Pie Chart, Bar Plots, Line charts, etc.

## Files
- AutoSales.py (The main python file that contains all the codes)
- Procfile (required for heroku deployment)
- requirements.txt (required for heroku deployment)
